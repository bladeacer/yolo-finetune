  \section{Findings}
  \subsection{Foreword}
  This was made for my assignment submission for the Advanced Topics in AI. For this assignment, I was tasked with finetuning a pre-trained Object Detection model to detect 2 classes of objects of my choice. I chose to finetune YOLOv11 on the `camel` and `buffalo` object classes. Approximately 1,500 images were labelled across these two object classes.

    \section{Data labelling}
    During the data labelling process, I encountered some data which would be not beneficial to include in the dataset. These include low resolution, irrelevant images and images in which the subject of interest is too far away or heavily overlapping. These were discarded so as to prevent irrelevant data from affecting training accuracy. 
    Labelling was done using Roboflow.
